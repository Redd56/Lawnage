# Intro to Lawnage
Welcome to lawnage! The primary function of this mod is to provide "Lawn" block types that are supposed to resemble "Mowed Lawn" for certain blocks.

# What kind of blocks are "Lawnable"?
Lawnage lets blocks like grass, mycelium, warped nylium and crimson nylium have lawn variants which have slightly different properties to the original block

# What does a lawn block do?
Lawn blocks are nearly entirely decorational and can be used to give your build that "tidy" look you were searchinng for!

# What about mod support?
We built this mod with external mod support in mind! We've built in lawn type variants for the following mods:
- Oh The Biomes You'll Go
- Cinderscapes

We are absolutely planing on adding more mod support and are totally willing to get your input on which ones to support first!

### If you are a mod creator that wants to have lawn types in our mod, feel free to create a [post](https://github.com/Redd56/Lawnage/issues) for your mod and what you're requesting
